# Calculator
---

A simple and responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for performing basic arithmetic operations.

---

## Overview

This project is a lightweight web-based calculator designed to perform everyday mathematical calculations in a clean and user-friendly interface. The focus of this project is to understand core front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI design without relying on frameworks.

---

## Problem Statement

Many beginners struggle with understanding how JavaScript interacts with the UI in real-time. This project solves that by demonstrating how basic logic, button events, and dynamic display updates work together in a real-world mini application.

## Tools and Technologies

* HTML – Structure of the calculator
* CSS – Styling and layout design
* JavaScript – Logic, event handling, and calculations

---

## Methods

* DOM selection and manipulation
* Event listeners for button clicks
* Conditional logic for operators
* String parsing and evaluation for expressions
* Responsive UI design using CSS

---

## Key Insights

* Learned how JavaScript handles real-time user interaction
* Understood the importance of separating UI and logic
* Practiced debugging DOM-based applications
* Gained clarity on handling edge cases like invalid inputs or multiple operators

---

## Output

The output is a fully functional calculator interface that supports:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Clear/reset functionality
* Responsive layout for different screen sizes
